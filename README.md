# aerial_local_planner
A ROS package that implements a 3D local planner based on a global plan. What makes it unique, is that it not only makes the robot stay in the global plan, but also land the robot on an estimated goal (not fixed), provided by the global planner.

It is part of a ROS eco-system of packages that allow an autonomous UAV to land on a moving platform, using only a front-facing camera.
